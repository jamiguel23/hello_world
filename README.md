# hello_world

This is my first Go application.

## Getting started

To run programs the source code and dependencies need to be compiled to executable binary.

The following goes in the command line:

```commandline
  go build <file name>
  ./<file name>
```

The **'go build'** command will cmpile for us. To execute type in **'./'** followed by the binary file name.
